I created my testing script `test.py` to test my web application. Want to make your own? let's find out how it works.

Initially my testing script loads the web application using `import` statement. `test_index` is the main testing
function which enable testing function of flask app and store it to a variable `client`. I have sent some `GET` and
`POST` request and check their response respectively.

It's very easy to understand my testing code for now.
